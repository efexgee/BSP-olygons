What is splitting?
    tree.split
        in: node_id, direction, location
        out: 2 node_ids
        - find the node
        - tell node to split
            (direction, location)
        - get 2 new nodes
        - add nodes as children to original node (in the tree)
        ? edges need to be updated
    node.split
        in: direction, location
        out: 2 nodes
        - get the 2 affected edges
        - calculate the 2 split points
        - determine new nodes' IDs
        - tell those edges to split
        - get 4 new edges
        - add 4 new edges to the registry
        - update all affected edges in the registry
    edge.split
        in: point
        out: 2 edges
        - get the line
        - tell the line to split
        - get two new lines
        - create two new edges with correct node IDs
        ? old edge needs to be deleted from the registry
    line.split
        in: point
        out: 2 lines
        - create two new lines
